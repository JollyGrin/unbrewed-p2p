# Unbrewed P2P

This aims to recreate unbrewed.xyz but with webrtc and typescript. This will allow players to connect directly to each other without need for a server. This also makes it easier to fork and remix to your liking without relying on the unbrewed server for games.

- [x] setup typescript: to auto-document code
- [x] setup jest (unit tests): to make refactoring and PRs easier
- [ ] add [webrtc](https://michal-wrzosek.github.io/p2p-chat/)
- [ ] add card template
- [ ] add game actions
